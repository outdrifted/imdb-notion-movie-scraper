# imdb-notion-movie-scraper
A C# console app (.NET Framework) that gets information about a list of movies/series from IMDb, then updates Notion page with the gathered new information.
Since this is a web scraper, IMDb site HTML elements might change, so it might be needed to update the CSS Selectors.
Since the Notion property names are hardcoded, so they must match exactly in Notion. I might make a template someday if needed.
